    <p>This is an easy recipe for delicious lasagna!</p>
    <p>
      The recipe given was a little incomplete. I had to fill in the
      <br />blanks by referring to a few cookbooks, but it sounded <br />so good
      that we just had to try it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yes it takes hours, and yes, it is worth it. Mr. Loco's commentary
      <br />is quite amusing, so I do encourage you to read it. <br />(just
      scroll down to the comments below)
    </p>
    <h2><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h2>
    <ul>
      <h3><strong>Bolognese Sauce:</strong></h3>
      <li>2 ounces diced pancetta, finely chopped</li>
      <li>1 medium Spanish onion or yellow onion, finely chopped</li>
      <li>1 rib celery, finely chopped</li>
      <li>1 carrot, finely chopped</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
      <li>11 ounces ground beef</li>
      <li>4 ounces ground pork</li>
      <li>4 ounces ground Italian sausage</li>
      <li>1 clove, freshly ground</li>
      <li>Dash freshly ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>
        2 pounds tomatoes , peeled and chopped,<br />
        or 1 (28-ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes
      </li>
      <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon sea salt</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <h3><strong>Béchamel Sauce:</strong></h3>
      <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
      <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <h3><strong>Lasagna</strong></h3>
      <li>
        About 16 sheets lasagna noodles (De Cecco brand recommended),<br />enough
        to make 4 layers in a 13 x 9-inch baking pan with the <br />noodles
        overlapping each other a little bit
      </li>
      <li>1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <h3><strong>Prepare the Bolognese Meat Sauce</strong></h3>
      <li>
        Make the soffritto: Combine pancetta, onion, celery, and carrot in sauté
        pan with butter and cook over medium heat until onion turns pale gold.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the other ingredients: Add the beef, pork, and sausage to the
        soffritto and increase the heat to high. Cook until browned. Sprinkle
        with the ground clove, cinnamon, and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the tomatoes: Stir in the tomatoes and bring to a simmer. Reduce the
        heat to medium. Cook over medium heat for 15 minutes. If you are using
        whole canned tomatoes, break them up as you add them to the sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the milk and simmer: Add the milk, season with sea salt, then turn
        down the heat and let simmer for 2 and 1/2 hours. Stir at least every 20
        minutes. Whenever the sauce simmers down to the point that it is
        sticking to the bottom of the pan, just add 1/4 cup of water and scrape
        up the browned bits from the bottom and continue to cook.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <ol>
      <h3><strong>Make the Béchamel Sauce</strong></h3>
      <li>
        Make the roux: Heat the milk until almost boiling in a heavy bottomed
        sauce pan. In a separate pan melt the unsalted butter with the flour
        over low heat. Stir rapidly with a spoon. Cook this for 1 minute and
        then remove from the heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add half the milk to the roux: Slowly add half the hot milk to your
        butter and flour mixture. During this process stir constantly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the remaining milk and thicken the sauce: Return the milk, butter,
        flour mixture to low heat until the sauce begins to thicken. Add the
        remaining milk slowly while stirring working it into the thickened
        sauce. Continue to stir until it comes to a boil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Season, then stir: Season with some sea salt, and continue stirring
        until the right consistency has developed. If any lumps form, beat them
        out rapidly with a whisk until they dissolve. Remove from heat.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <ol>
      <h3><strong>Prepare the Lasagna</strong></h3>
      <li>Preheat oven to 375°F.</li>
      <li>
        Cook the lasagna noodles: Cook the lasagna according to instructions.
        About 8 minutes in 6 quarts of boiling salted water. Drain, rinse with
        cold water. Lay the individual lasagna noodles out on kitchen towels,
        not touching, so they do not stick together while you layer the
        casserole.
      </li>
      <li>
        Layer the lasagna: Spread a little olive oil around the inside of a
        13x9-inch baking pan. Make sure your baking pan is non-reactive - pyrex
        or stainless steel. Do not use an aluminum pan as it will react with the
        acidity of the sauce and ruin the flavor. Put a layer of lasagna noodles
        down first. Layer on a third of the bolognese sauce, then a third of the
        bechamel sauce. Sprinkle with grated Parmesan. Repeat two more times.
        Top with a final layer of noodles and sprinkle with grated Parmesan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake: Tent the casserole with aluminum foil. Put lasagna into the middle
        rack of a pre-heated 375°F oven. Bake for 20 to 30 minutes, until the
        top begins to get lightly browned. Remove from oven and let cool for 5
        to 10 minutes before serving.
      </li>
    </ol>
